The goal of this assignment is to gain experience deeply understanding a paper so that you can teach others about it. It is beneficial to discuss papers as a group to understand better and hear others' perspectives.

I will assign everyone into groups of three people. As a group, you will select and review a paper. The paper needs to come from a recent peer-reviewed conference relating to wireless networking. The paper needs to be approved by me. As a starting point, you can look at papers from one of the following conferences:

- MobiCom ([2020](https://sigmobile.org/mobicom/2020/program.php){:target="_blank"}, [2019](https://sigmobile.org/mobicom/2019/program.php){:target="_blank"}, and [2018](https://sigmobile.org/mobicom/2018/program.php){:target="_blank"})
- MobiSys ([2020](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobisys/2020/program/){:target="_blank"}, [2019](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobisys/2019/program/){:target="_blank"}, and [2018](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobisys/2018/program/){:target="_blank"})
- Sensys ([2020](http://sensys.acm.org/2020/program/){:target="_blank"}, [2019](http://sensys.acm.org/2019/program/){:target="_blank"}, and [2018](http://sensys.acm.org/2018/program/){:target="_blank"})
- IoTDI ([2020](https://conferences.computer.org/iotDI/prev/2020/program.html){:target="_blank"}, [2019](https://conferences.computer.org/iotDI/prev/2019/){:target="_blank"}, and [2018](https://conferences.computer.org/iotDI/prev/2018/pgm.html){:target="_blank"})
- IPSN ([2020](https://ipsn.acm.org/2020/program.html){:target="_blank"}, [2019](https://ipsn.acm.org/2019/program.html){:target="_blank"}, and [2018](https://ipsn.acm.org/2018/program.html){:target="_blank"})
- WiSec ([2020](https://wisec2020.ins.jku.at/accepted-papers/){:target="_blank"}, [2019](https://wisec19.fiu.edu/full-program){:target="_blank"}, and [2018](https://wisec18.conf.kth.se/sites/program.html){:target="_blank"})

Make sure the paper you select is related to wireless networking. I expect you to meet as a group to review the paper. There are a few minor milestones along the way to make sure everyone is participating equally.

## Paper Selection
Every person in the group must suggest **two papers**. As a group, you will discuss the papers and decide which paper you would like to review. You must submit all the papers suggested and your decision on Learning Suite (any format is fine).

## Group Meetings
To help facilitate good group discussions and fairness, I require you to meet as a group **at least once** to discuss the paper. However, I encourage you to meet more than that!

## Presentation
Presentations need to be **15 minutes** long, but plan for a few minutes of questions. Each member of the group needs to be part of the presentation. You can choose how to break it up between group members as you see fit, but it would make sense to have one person present on each section.
