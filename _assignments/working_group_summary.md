The IEEE updates the 802.11 standard using task groups (or working groups). These groups of people explore ways of improving specific aspects of the standard. For example, task group (TG) "r" explored the idea of speeding up the security transition between two different access points. The innovations of TGr were rolled into the standard as an amendment in 2008 ([IEEE 802.11r](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11r-2008){:target="_blank"}). The IEEE publishes all of the notes and presentations that were given during these task group meetings on [their website](https://mentor.ieee.org/802.11/documents){:target="_blank"}.

For this assignment, you will dig through these documents and explore what a task group is working on. Pick a task group (preferably an active one) and read the documents that have been uploaded. The website has an option to filter by the task group. Usually, the earlier Powerpoint presentations are more informative. Some of the documents are not very helpful, so you will need to do some digging. Summarize what the task group is all about. If it helps, here are some questions you can answer in your summary:

- What use cases (or usage models) are the task group trying to accommodate?
- What is the task group doing to the standard to improve it?
- What problems is the task group dealing with?
- What did you learn as you were searching through the documents?

This review should be similar to a paper review in terms of the time taken to complete the assignment.
