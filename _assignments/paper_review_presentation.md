The goal of this assignment is to gain experience *deeply* understanding a paper so that you can teach others about it. You will select and review a paper. The paper needs to come from a recent peer-reviewed conference relating to wireless networking. The paper needs to be approved by me. As a starting point, you can look at papers from one of the following conferences:

- MobiCom ([2023](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2023/accepted.html), [2022](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2022/accepted.html), [2021](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2021/accepted.html), and [2020](https://sigmobile.org/mobicom/2020/program.php))
- MobiSys ([2023](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobisys/2023/accepted-papers.html), [2022](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobisys/2022/program.html), [2021](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobisys/2021/program.html), and [2020](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobisys/2020/program/))
- SenSys ([2023](https://sensys.acm.org/2023/program/), [2022](https://sensys.acm.org/2022/program/), [2021](https://sensys.acm.org/2021/program/), and [2020](http://sensys.acm.org/2020/program/))
- IoTDI ([2023](https://conferences.computer.org/iotDI/2023/program.html), [2022](https://conferences.computer.org/iotDI/2022/papers.html), [2021](https://conferences.computer.org/iotDI/2021/papers.html), and [2020](https://conferences.computer.org/iotDI/prev/2020/program.html))
- IPSN ([2023](https://ipsn.acm.org/2023/papers.html), [2022](https://ipsn.acm.org/2022/program.html), [2021](https://ipsn.acm.org/2021/program.html), and [2020](https://ipsn.acm.org/2020/program.html))

Make sure the paper you select is related to wireless networking.

## Presentation
Presentations need to be **14 minutes** long, but plan for a minute of questions. The presentation should not only teach us about the paper but also give us details on what you liked about the paper and what you didn't like about the paper. Remember, this is a *review*, not a paper summary. We want *insights* and not just information.

Here is a rough outline of how the presentation should flow:

**Introduction (~3 minutes)** <!-- 5 points -->
- Clearly introduce and motivate the problem the paper is addressing

**Summary (~5 minutes)** <!-- 15 points -->
- Describes the problem well enough for someone to understand
- Describes the proposed solution from the paper
- Presents results from the paper

**Review (~5 minutes)** <!-- 15 points -->
- Thoughtful strengths identified and discussed
  - What was transformative about this research?
  - What part of the research was most convincing?
  
- Thoughtful weaknesses identified and discussed
  - Did the paper have any flaws?
  - What could have been improved?

**Questions (~1 minute)**
