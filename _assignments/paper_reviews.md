As a grad student, it is important to read, understand, and review research papers. To get practice at this, we will be reviewing a few papers throughout the semester. Reviews should answer the following sections/questions:

1. Paper summary

2. What problem does the paper address?

3. How is it different from previous work, if any?

4. What is the approach used to solve the problem?

5. How does the paper support or otherwise justify its arguments and conclusions?

6. Was the paper, in your estimation, successful in addressing the problem?

7. List two important research questions on the topic and why they matter.

All paper reviews must use the following [template]({% link assets/paper_review.txt %}){:target="_blank"}. The review should be thorough and thoughtful. Submit the review before class starts.
