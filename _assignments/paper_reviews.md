1. Paper Summary (4-6 sentences)

2. What problem is addressed and is the solution viable, why? (3-4 sentences)

3. How is this different from previous work? (2-3 sentences)

4. What important research questions would further this work (2+ sentences)

5. Is this a good paper? What are its strengths, what are its weaknesses? Would you recommend this paper to a conference? Assess technical contribution, novelty, writing quality, relevance. (4-6 sentences)

All paper reviews must use the following [template]({% link assets/paper_review.txt %}){:target="_blank"}. The review should be thorough and thoughtful. Submit the review before class starts.
