As a grad student, it is important to read, understand, and review research papers. To get practice at this, we will be reviewing a few papers throughout the semester. Reviews should contain the following sections:

1. A summary of the paper. Make sure to touch on the paper's claimed contributions, the general methodology for achieving those claims, and evaluation of the methodology.

2. Strengths of the paper.

3. Weaknesses of the paper.

All paper reviews must use the following [template]({% link assets/paper_review.tex %}). The review should be about **one full page** (i.e., two columns). Submit the review as a PDF before class starts.
