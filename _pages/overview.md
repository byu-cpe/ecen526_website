## Course Makeup

There are seven major components to this course:

- **Paper Reviews**. You will be writing short reviews for papers that we read throughout the semester. You will summarize the paper and give the paper's strengths and weaknesses.

- **Homeworks**. There are four homeworks that help reinforce the concepts you learn during the lecture.

- **Labs**. Labs give you hands-on experience with the concepts you are learning about in class.

- **Exam**. There will be one midterm about halfway through the semester. Sorry.

- **Group Paper Review**. It is helpful to discuss and review papers with other people. You will be assigned a group to select and review a paper together.

- **Course Project**. A semester-long project where you can choose the topic.

- **Participation**. This is a grad class, so I expect good participation. You will be graded on your participation.

## Communication
All communication will be done over Slack. Slack is intended to be used for announcements, questions, and facilitate student communication. If you have a question, ask it on Slack so that everyone can benefit from seeing the question and answer. 

## Attendance and Participation
This is a grad, and I expect grad-level participation. I expect all students to be at every lecture and engage in the lecture. Asking and answering questions in class is essential. When you are in a lecture, I expect your attention, so students should not be on their phones or doing non-class related things on their computers. Your participation will be graded using the following scale (out of 4 points):

 - **4 points**. Engaged in class, taking notes, and asking questions. 
 - **3 points**. Occasionally asks questions, mostly engaged in class. Sometimes seems more interested in their laptop.
 - **2 points**. Rarely engages in the class. Looks disinterested in what is being taught. 
 - **1 point**. Doesnâ€™t show an effort to participate in class. Does not show up or is consistently late.
 - **0 points**. Did you take the class?

## Late Policy
Don't turn in late assignments. For an assignment that is one day late, you get 80% credit. For an assignment that is two days late, you get 50% credit. You receive no credit if your assignment is more than two days late. If you are sick, no deductions will be taken if you let me know before the assignment is due.

## Source Code Sharing
Students are not allowed to share source code. Students can work on assignments together, but no direct or indirect copying from another student is allowed. This class will use a code similarity checker to determine if students are copying code.

## Policies

### COVID-19 Statement
While COVID-19 conditions persist and until further notice, students and faculty are required to wear face coverings at all times during class; faculty are not at liberty to waive this expectation.

Students who feel sick, including exhibiting symptoms commonly associated with COVID 19 (fever; cough; shortness of breath/difficulty breathing; chills; muscle pain; sore throat; new loss of taste or smell; etc.) should not attend class and should work with their instructor to develop a study plan for the duration of the illness.

### Honor Code
In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code, students are expected to be honest in all of their academic work. Academic honesty means, most fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must in fact be your own work and not that of another. Violations of this principle may result in a failing grade in the course and additional disciplinary action by the university. Students are also expected to adhere to the Dress and Grooming Standards. Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself and others and ensures an effective learning and working environment. It is the university's expectation, and every instructor's expectation in class, that each student will abide by all Honor Code standards. Please call the Honor Code Office at 422-2847 if you have questions about those standards.

### Preventing & Responding to Sexual Misconduct
In accordance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Brigham Young University prohibits unlawful sex discrimination against any participant in its education programs or activities. The university also prohibits sexual harassment-including sexual violence-committed by or against students, university employees, and visitors to campus. As outlined in university policy, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking are considered forms of "Sexual Misconduct" prohibited by the university.

University policy requires all university employees in a teaching, managerial, or supervisory role to report all incidents of Sexual Misconduct that come to their attention in any way, including but not limited to face-to-face conversations, a written class assignment or paper, class discussion, email, text, or social media post. Incidents of Sexual Misconduct should be reported to the Title IX Coordinator at t9coordinator@byu.edu or (801) 422-8692. Reports may also be submitted through EthicsPoint at https://titleix.byu.edu/report or 1-888-238-1062 (24-hours a day).

BYU offers confidential resources for those affected by Sexual Misconduct, including the university's Victim Advocate, as well as a number of non-confidential resources and services that may be helpful. Additional information about Title IX, the university's Sexual Misconduct Policy, reporting requirements, and resources can be found at http://titleix.byu.edu or by contacting the university's Title IX Coordinator.

### Student Disability
Brigham Young University is committed to providing a working and learning atmosphere that reasonably accommodates qualified persons with disabilities. A disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Whether an impairment is substantially limiting depends on its nature and severity, its duration or expected duration, and its permanent or expected permanent or long-term impact. Examples include vision or hearing impairments, physical disabilities, chronic illnesses, emotional disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety), learning disorders, and attention disorders (e.g., ADHD). If you have a disability which impairs your ability to complete this course successfully, please contact the University Accessibility Center (UAC), 2170 WSC or 801-422-2767 to request a reasonable accommodation. The UAC can also assess students for learning, attention, and emotional concerns. If you feel you have been unlawfully discriminated against on the basis of disability, please contact the Equal Employment Office at 801-422-5895, D-285 ASB for help.

### Academic Honesty
The first injunction of the Honor Code is the call to "be honest." Students come to the university not only to improve their minds, gain knowledge, and develop skills that will assist them in their life's work, but also to build character. "President David O. McKay taught that character is the highest aim of education" (The Aims of a BYU Education, p.6). It is the purpose of the BYU Academic Honesty Policy to assist in fulfilling that aim. BYU students should seek to be totally honest in their dealings with others. They should complete their own work and be evaluated based upon that work. They should avoid academic dishonesty and misconduct in all its forms, including but not limited to plagiarism, fabrication or falsification, cheating, and other academic misconduct.
