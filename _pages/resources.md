For the course, we will be using material from different online resources. Links to the material are posted on the schedule. If you are interested in a book, the following are a useful reference for the material we will be covering in this class (though they are not required):

- [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Networking-Top-Down-Approach-7th/dp/0133594149){:target="_blank"}. This book is really good, and you will not regret buying it. If you are thinking of a career in networking, then this book is a must-have. I reference it often in my research.
